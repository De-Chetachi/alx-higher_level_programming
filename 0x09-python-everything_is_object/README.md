everything is object...
mutable vs immutable objects
saying it is immutable means it cant be changed is quite ambigiuse
everything is an objects means everything is an instance of a class;
so when u declare an object and assign a variable/name to it, u created an instance ofa predefined class, named (variable/name) stored in a space  in memory, the space in memory can be accessed with the id function

this id space in memory is going to help us understand the behaviour of mutable and unmutable data.

now for immutable data say list...
